Following are the chef commands that can be run from the node itself.
# Run the chef-client utility on the node this will update the client with new recipe
chef-client

# Below code will test the run and tell you what recipes will be executed.
chef-client --why-run

# Below code will run all the recipes in the cookbook
chef-client

#  For running just the recipe for ssl cert use the below code
#  chef-client -o 'recipe[cookbook_name::recipe_name]'
chef-client -o 'recipe[bl_ng_role_sql_server::sslcert]'

Alternately if you donâ€™t want to run this from the node and want to run from workstation then use the below script.
# use the below code to test the recipe from worksation to see what the recipe 
# would do on execution
knife ssh 'name:NODENAME' 'sudo chef-client -o "recipe[bl_ng_role_sql_server::sslcert]" --why-run' -i /path/to/ssh/key -x SSH-USERNAME

# below code for actual run 
knife ssh 'name:NODENAME' 'sudo chef-client -o "recipe[bl_ng_role_sql_server::sslcert]"' -i /path/to/ssh/key -x SSH-USERNAME
